Now using Qt 5.9
fixed some issues

-------------------------
Switched from QtQuick.Controls 1.4 to QtQuick.Controls 2.0 so this compiles also for Android
Now Webview works also on Android 4.2.2

MNotes now give you access to MS OneNote.
In this version its a readonly access.


The UI has also changed, so that it is easier to make a port to a mobile device.

This version needs Qt >= 5.7 to run
