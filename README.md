# MNotes

## Multinotes tracker for Linux
### one app for various notes

Read and/or write notes from multiple locations
Each location has its own tab button

With this actual version you can fully manage your Notes
in a Next-/Owncloud

Note:
* MNotes is currently in an alpha version
* login data are stored unencrypted
* the access to OneNote in MS Office 365 is more or less a proof of concept, to see how OAuth authentication can be realized in a desktop app

Note on Own-/Nexcloud:
* notes in Next-/Owncloud are using the first line as a title.
So titles can be changed by editing the first line in your note

**New Features in this version:**
-----------------------------

* Read, write, add new, delete notes from Next-/Owncloud

-----------------------------

* Read and write notes locally
* Read notes from Next-/Owncloud
* Read notes from O365/OneNote 

-------------------------
Now using Qt 5.9
fixed some issues

-------------------------
Switched from QtQuick.Controls 1.4 to QtQuick.Controls 2.0 so this compiles also for Android
Now Webview works also on Android 4.2.2

MNotes now give you access to MS OneNote.
In this version its a readonly access.


The UI has also changed, so that it is easier to make a port to a mobile device.

This version needs Qt >= 5.7 to run
